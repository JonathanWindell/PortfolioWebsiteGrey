            This project was developed as a learning exercise to help me acquire knowledge coding
            in C#. This was the course project and it gave a lot of insight into how to code object oriented.
            I won't share any pictures of the project as it is a console application. If you want to check out the
            source code of this project you just go over to my github account!
